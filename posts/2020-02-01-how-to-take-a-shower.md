# How to take a shower
In three steps:

1. Get wet
2. Get soaped
3. Get rinsed

Ideally, it will take just three minutes for the simple process to wet, soap, and rinse.

Need an app to help with showers that take too long? Try the open source app, [Shower Smart](https://github.com/danialgoodwin/shower-smart), _'annoying' on purpose_. (_made by me with Flutter_)
